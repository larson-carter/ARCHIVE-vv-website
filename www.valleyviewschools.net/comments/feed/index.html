					<description><![CDATA[I have figured out some points through your website post. One other stuff I would like to talk about is that there are several games out there designed in particular for preschool age children. They involve pattern acknowledgement, colors, creatures, and forms. These generally focus on familiarization as opposed to memorization. This helps to keep little children engaged without experiencing like they are studying. Thanks]]></description>
